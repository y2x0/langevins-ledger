|---|---|
| The VP transition kernel `x_t = α_t x_0 + σ_t ε`, via integrating factor | 01 |

| CFG's score is the gradient of the per-t geometric tilt `p_t(x|y)^ω p_t(x)^{1−ω}` | 05 |

| CFG is exact for jointly Gaussian data (tilting commutes with the semigroup) | 05 |
| Gaussian data: score, Wiener-filter denoiser, and sampler all exact in closed form | 06 |
| The empirical measure's optimal denoiser is softmax attention over the training set | 06 |

## samplers_and_convergence/

| Result | File |
|---|---|
| Exact EM discretization bias in the Gaussian case: `v* = 1/(1 − βh/4)` | 01 |
| The quadrature identity: exact PF-ODE solution = `ρ⁻²`-weighted integral of `x̂₀` | 02 |
| DDIM is the zeroth-order quadrature rule; second-order error constants derived | 02 |
| The Girsanov KL decomposition: prior + score error + discretization, additive | 03 |

| Robustness is bought quadratically in λ (restoring coefficient `−λ²β/2`) | 05 |

## flow_matching/

| Result | File |
|---|---|
| The marginal velocity generates the path (continuity equation, weak form) | 01 |
| The CFM identity: per-pair regression = marginal-velocity regression | 01 |
| The interpolant score formula `s = −E[z|x_t]/γ_t` (latent buys a score) | 02 |

| Rectification preserves marginals (under well-posedness) | 03 |
| Every convex transport cost weakly decreases under rectification (double Jensen) | 03 |
| Straight couplings are exactly the fixed points; one Euler step exact on them | 03 |
| Marginal preservation FAILS for the atomic crossing coupling (worked) | 03 |
| The smoothed crossing rectifies to the monotone coupling (odd-symmetry proof) | 03 |
| The dictionary: `v* = (β̇/β)x + γ(β̇γ/β − γ̇)s` on Gaussian paths | 04 |
| Velocity stays regular where the score blows up (endpoint cancellation) | 04 |
| In d = 1 the FM flow map is monotone, hence optimal transport | 05 |
| The FM path ≠ the OT geodesic (the two-atom bulge, exact) | 05 |

## guidance_and_control/

| Result | File |
|---|---|
| `h_t(x_t)` is a reverse-time martingale (tower property) | 01 |
| The h-transform adds `g²∇log h` to the drift (generator computation) | 01 |
| Exact conditioning = the Doob h-transform of the reverse process | 01 |
| The plug-in guidance error is exactly `g²∇log(h/ĥ)` — expectation vs plug-in | 01 |
| The Gaussian ω-family exactly: `Λ_ω = ωΛ_c + (1−ω)Λ_u`, mean extrapolation | 02 |
| CFG variance shrinks below the conditional, monotonically in ω | 02 |
| The Jensen gap ≤ `(b−a)²/8` (Hoeffding's lemma under the posterior) | 02 |
| ω → ∞ is classifier ascent (sampling degenerates into optimization) | 02 |
| Exact inverse-problem guidance for Gaussian priors: `S_t = A C_t Aᵀ + σ_y²I` | 03 |
| DPS deletes the posterior covariance — overweighting ratio computed (×51) | 03 |
| KL-regularized reward fine-tuning: closed form `dQ*/dP ∝ e^{r/β}` (path space) | 04 |
| The optimum is the h-transform of the pretrained sampler by `E[e^{r/β}|x_t]` | 04 |
| `V = β log h` solves the HJB; Hopf–Cole linearizes it (linearly solvable control) | 04 |
| Path KL = expected quadratic control cost (Girsanov dictionary) | 04 |
